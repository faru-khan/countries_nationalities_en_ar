# countries_nationalities_en_ar
The following JSON contains the list of countries , that also includes the country codes , 
nationalities etc , all of the data contains the data in both English and Arabic. 
This JSON was created by merging 3 JSONs , so the data may be inaccurate. also for 81 countries the nationality 
in Arabic was not found , so we assigned the arabic name of the country to the nationality as well. 

NOTE : We have only used the names , nationalities as of now, and are not 100% sure on the accuracy of the data.
Feel free to suggest any updates to the JSON.
